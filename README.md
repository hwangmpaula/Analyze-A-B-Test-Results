# What is the A/B Testing?
AB testing is a type of experimentation that helps to compare two different versions of a web page to check which one has more clicks or visitors. 

# Project:

For this project, I am working on to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.
The company has developed a new web page to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.
The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

##### The Goal to Complete the project:
  
  - Answers to the questions
  - Code to solve the problems 
  - Comments when necessary

##### Another Files in Analyze-A-B-Test-Results:
  - "ab_data.csv" and "countries.csv" are files that consists of data and used as to data analyzation. 
  - "Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook_original.ipynb" is the file project, written in python and jupyter notebook
  - "Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.html" can be display in html

### 

##### Analyze-A-B-Test-Results uses some open source projects to work properly:

* [Jupyter Notebook] or [Python 3] - jupyter notebook is an open source and used to data analyze with python code
* [matplotlib] - uses to facilitate the data analyzation by displaying the plots
* [numpy] - is a fundamental scientific computing.
* [Pandas] - uses to clean, organize, convert, and merge the data.
